# Elden-Ring-Rune-Predictor-ERRP
A Elden Ring Rune Predictor (or ERRP) using C++ and the wxwidget library to create an executable. When running the exe, you input your current level then desired number of level ups (inputing 1 gives you 1 stat point).


I followed this awesome tutorial on YouTube from

To edit this code, you must install the wxwidget library for win32 and x64 versions. OttoBotCode's tutorial covers how to do it for Visual Studio. It says to use the latest version in the video, but the latest version is 17 of VS. I was able to use that with my VS 19 and not have any problems.

Once you have set up the library and you want to make an executable out of your work, I suggest following this YouTube tutorial from
